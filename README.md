**D**irected and **U**n**D**irected **T**emporal **N**etwork software. Version 2.0


## About DUDTeN

The DUDTeN software is created to estimate dynamic functional connectivity (also known as time-varying functional connectivity) and calculate undirected and directed temporal measures in a very simple way. Only, load your data, select the options, save the result, and see them. 

DUDTeN is a user-friendly software that users can investigate the Temporal Networks only by selecting the options, with no need to write codes. So, this software helps to accelerate the studies in the temporal network field.


## Installation

The "DUDTeN v2.0" currently only available for Windows OS.

This software is developed in MATLAB R2018a. 

Two executable files (_DUDTeN.exe_ and _DUDTeN_MRT.exe_) have been created. The DUDTeN_MRT executable file contains version 9.4 (R2018a) of the MATLAB Runtime. If the correct version of the MATLAB Runtime exists on the system, it is better to download the DUDTeN.exe.

You can download the _DUDTeN.exe_ or _DUDTeN_MRT.exe_ at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4384756)

In a few minutes, you can install and use DUDTeN, with no need to download and install any other files. 

For the first time, double-click DUDTeN.exe or DUDTeN_MRT.exe. Wait for a few seconds/minutes. The installer opens. Follow the steps for installing. Finally, the installer installs DUDTeN. Then, double-click DUD10 icon to run and use it.

In the _Manual_DUDTeN_v2.pdf_, the steps of installation DUDTeN are presented. Also, how to use this software, the description of parts and options, and the examples are expressed.
